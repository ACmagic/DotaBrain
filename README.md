# DotaBrain
A Dota2 Hero Recommendation Engine Based On MachineLearning Techs And MonteCarlo Search

## Introduction
- DotaBrain is a dota2 game hero recommendation engine using machine learning and artificial intelligence technology.
- DotaBrain learns a predictive model that maps the hero composition of both team to the match outcome, the predictive accuracy exceeds that of many experienced players in a test.
- Based on this predictive model, DotaBrain further uses [MonteCarlo Tree Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) algorithm which is a key algorithm for many board games AI like [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo) to provide players with real-time hero recommendation.
